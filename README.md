# Analysis of electoral performances in Minas Gerais (2010-2022)

<p>Minas Gerais is a decisive state for Brazilian elections, not only because of its 20 million inhabitants and 16 million voters (10.41% of the national electorate), but also because, since redemocratization in 1985, all elected Presidents have obtained a majority in the State.</p>

<p>in Brazil, the computation is done considering each vote individually, the winner is whoever reaches the majority of valid votes (excluding blank and null votes).</p>

<p>Thus, although there is this coincidence between the Minas Gerais and Brazilian elections, the State is not decisive for the victory of a candidate, and the performance of a candidate may be much better in other States enough to guarantee victory.</p>

<p>However, this coincidence has occurred since the redemocratization.</p>

<p>Despite this eventuality, the distribution of votes in the State has changed over the years, following the political transformations in the country.</p>
<p>From a more homogeneous distribution in the State, it moved to a heterogeneous distribution demarcated by the mesoregions.</p>
